Class exercise 2 

Welcome to our project!
Our goal for this project is to learn more about scraping and trying to do it in practice.
We followed the steps required to achieve our final goal. We checked what we were allowed to scrape, we downloaded the page providing the information needed about us, and then we started to manage the data we got.

Hopefully this project will make us closer to being proficient in scraping one day.
As usual we followed a tidy-data structure in our project, organizing our work in folders.
1. **DATA FOLDER** : This folder contains the html pages we downloaded.
